            <p>April Yi Hyang Oh was born in South Korea and raised in Vietnam due to immigration during her early childhood years. During her transition, she experienced a sudden and extreme change in her cultural surrounding, which influenced heavily in the formation of her social and cultural self. Living in a strange land as a stranger for a long period of time, she was encompassed to question the idea of "home" as well as identity. Through Photography, she examines different ways of defining "home" and hence finding a sense of belonging. April has rich understanding of cultures and she desires to find coherency and ubiquitous beauty within different spaces in different places.<br><br>For more information, please visit:</p>
